Description: The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design framework, a 
  model-assisted approach for identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
  in Phase I clinical trials, has become the standard method for dose-finding 
  in oncology. In combination dose escalation studies, we usually have studied
  the safety profile of each drug used as monotherapy. BOIN combination design
  was proposed with all possible combinations explored. However, a practical 
  preference based on prior clinical knowledge is often available for specific 
  dose combinations or omitting certain doses. As a result, the BOIN combination
  design is usually not suitable for practical use. To address this need,
  we have developed and evaluated a generalized BOIN combination design that 
  incorporates the preference (BOIN-CombP). Three categories of preference 
  are considered including preferred, lower priority, and not considered. 
  The performance of BOIN-CombP design has been evaluated by extensive 
  simulations. The simulations demonstrated that the probability of selecting
  the correct MTD increases if it is among the preferred doses while the 
  BOIN-CombP design achieves comparable toxicity control as the BOIN Combination
  design (BOIN-Comb).
